A demo site showing a few tricks for improving the sign in experience.

To try the site out:

# Step 1: Enable the Google+ API

Create a [Google APIs Console project](https://code.google.com/apis/console),
OAuth 2.0 client ID, enable the Google+ service, and register your JavaScript 
origins.

# Step 2. Set up the site

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` in index.html with the client id you set up in Step 1.

# Step 3. Start the site

Either copy the folder to your web server or start a local web server. I 
personally find the Python built-in server to be great for testing. To start
it on port 8000, run:

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
